# Linear-Regression-With-Gradient-Descent
Perform linear regression technique with different gradient descent algorithms

# Gradient Descent algorithms used
Batch gradient descent 
Stochastic gradient descent 

# GENDATA.py 
This script generates a csv with x and y values to perform linear regression
on it

# Note:
This will be updated in future with other gradient descent algorithms
